# Fonts
Fonts I draw are placed here to be available for everyone.

# Tools
Some or all fonts include CLI/Shell/script tools to set them external of programs created using an environment that otherwise requires the distribution of copyrighted diskfont.library/SetFont files from a WB disk with your release.

# Blitz
This repo was created specifically for AmiGameJam2025, and inspired by [this thread on EAB](https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=112250&page=5), and there's now thanks to Honitos an [AmiBlitz](https://github.com/AmiBlitz/AmiBlitz3/tree/develop) plugin that will let you include fonts in Blitz.

# Example
This is 'GameStory', an International font supporting ANSI characters.
