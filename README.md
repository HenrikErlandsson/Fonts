# Fonts
Fonts I draw are placed here to be available for everyone.

# Tools
Some or all fonts include CLI/Shell/script tools to set them external of programs created using an environment that requires diskfont.library.

# Blitz
This repo was inspired by [this thread on EAB](https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=112250&page=5), and for Blitz specifically there's now thanks to Honitos [AmiBlitz](https://github.com/AmiBlitz/AmiBlitz3/tree/develop) a plugin that will let you include any fonts, not just the ones I put here!

# Example
International font supporting ANSI characters.
