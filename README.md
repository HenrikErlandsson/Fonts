# Fonts
Fonts I draw are placed here to be available for everyone.

# Tools
Some or all fonts include tools to set them external of binaries or scripts created requiring diskfont.library.

# Blitz
The repo was inspired by [this thread on EAB](https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=112250&page=5), and for Blitz specifically there's now thanks to Honitos a plugin that will let you include any fonts not just the ones I put here.
